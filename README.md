The point of the project is to reproduce the experiment of Berlucchi and colleague. Our displayed stimulus will be a square patch of light, with one square degree in area, that will be flashed on different points of the screen.

We will design one session of the original experience (which had 3 of them). One session is composed of 4 blocks, of 15 trials each, with one stimulus display at each trial.

The duration of the stimulus is 32 msec.

A warning "ready" signal, delivered to the subject visually (becaus ewe don't have an intercome), preceded the stimulus. The duration of the fore-period was randomly varied with a range of 2 to 3 sec.

If a subject made an anticipatory response or did not respond within a certain period, this response was discarded and the subject was given another trial. Anticipatory responses were defined as any reaction time less than 180, 190 and 200 msec, for the retinal positions of 5, 20 and 35 degrees respectively, while the limits of delay of response for the same stimulus positions were 320, 350 and 380 msec.
