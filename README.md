The point of the project is to reproduce the experiment of Berlucchi and colleague. Our displayed stimulus will be a square patch of light, with one square
degree in area, that will be flashed on different points of the screen.

We will design one session of the original experience (which had 3 of them). One session is composed of 4 blocks, of 15 trials each, with one stimulus display at each trial.
